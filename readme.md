# Summary of Work
    The project sets a sort of psudo dictionary of mystery related words as defined by a sailor's dictionary. 

# Instructions for running the project
    For the first step GPT-2 was trained on The Sailor's Word-Book by W. H. Smyth to create a bank of word definitions. Chat-GPT was then used to generate tracery logic with a word bank of around 50 words related to a mystery theme. From there the generated word definitions from GPT-2 and the word bank from Chat-GPT was combined using tracery to generate  dictionary entries that. 

# Selected sample outputs
    Enigma (noun): An officer in the royal navy; the other officers are midshipmen.

    Unclear (verb): A term in the north for a dunlin or hove-to fish.

    Intrigue (verb): When a man kicks his butt on the ground that it strikes, he puts his hand on the wrong side of the cut-water, and as soon as he can heaves it well.
    
    Cryptogram (verb): To move any object by means of the water. See FLOATING DEW-STONE.

# Artist Statement
    Some inspiration for this project is from Janelle's How to Begin a novel that was trained on the start of more that 10,000 novels to produce book hooks. I liked the idea of breaking down language in a short structured way that could be expanded with several entries to go on almost infinately while still following a logic that doesn't wander off.
